# EDCrypt
This is a Java program that is very much probably the least cryptographically secure example of symmetric key cryptography, in an isolated setting. It compiles and runs using the OpenJDK sdk/jre, but originally I wrote and compiled this probably in spring of 2012 or Fall/Winter 2011 using the java sdk that was current at the time using Eclipse.

The methods/algorithms could be implemented in other ways, or modified to work on certain blocks of Unicode. This only really works in the code block that is the same as ASCII, and its otherwise broken. For example, using ðŸ˜€ in your message.txt will have unintended or intended results.
