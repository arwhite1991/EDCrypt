# EDCrypt
This is a Java program that is very much probably the least cryptographically secure example of symmetric key cryptography, in an isolated setting. It compiles and runs using the OpenJDK sdk/jre, but originally I wrote and compiled this probably in spring of 2012 or Fall/Winter 2011 using the java sdk that was current at the time using Eclipse.
